# AB-Testing-New-page-vs-Old-page
A mini case study of A/B-testing to get a better understanding of this technique  and how it is used in Python.

This mini case is actually from DataCamp course <i>A/B Testing in R</i> where I have taken the datasets. The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of A/B testing concept and how to use it with Python. I have also used a formula from <i>Customer Analytics and A/B-testing in Python</i> to determine the power.

In this project I will cover:
*    Baseline conversion rate 
*    Power analysis for experimental design and how different parameter influence power
*    A/B-testing
